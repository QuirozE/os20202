# Argument Passing

In this lab work, argument passing for user programs is implemented.

All the arguments are manually copied from the input string into the user stack.

## Build and run

The changes are conded as patches at `/patches`. To apply them use

```bash
$ git am
```

 And run the system normally.

## Tests

The pertinent tests in this labwork are

* `args-none`
* `args-sigle`
* `args-multiple`
* `args-many`
* `args-dbl.space`

All should be runned with diskspace.
